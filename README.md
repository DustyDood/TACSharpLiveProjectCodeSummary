# Tech Academy C# Live Project Code Summary

Introduction
For the end of my C# course with the Tech Academy, I worked on a team to help develop and refine an MVC web application for a theatre troupe. We utilized Scrum methodology in Azure DevOps, which involved daily standups and code retrospectives.

I started the project by familiarizing myself with the code, exploring links, testing what was working, and making note of what needed improvement. My first story on the project involved front-end maintenance, as I created a custom scroll bar to match the color theme of the application. Afterwards, I dove heavily into back-end MVC core principles.

Back-end stories:
1. Creating Models and related Crud pages
2. Creating a partial view for a model
3. Stylizing the partial view
4. Using AJAX to make calls to our database
5. Utilizing a Bootstrap modal and AJAX for database entry deletion.
